This project explores Classic Models database, a sample database commonly used for learning SQL. The database contains tables representing a fictional company's operations, 
including employees, customers, orders, products, and offices. Through this project, I have demonstrated various SQL concepts, including data retrieval, aggregation and joins. 
Key highlights include extracting basic information on revenue and analyzing customer order patterns. This project highlights practical SQL skills and the ability to derive 
meaningful business insights from data.
